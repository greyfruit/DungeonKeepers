game-prototype



Hi, it's a simple game without any game engines (doesn't use SpriteKit too), made by me for final course project!
Game based on Rock-Paper-Scissors (Water-Fire-Earth) battle system, you need to chose your element and then enemy randomly takes the form of one of your characters. If you can hit him will present "tapper", where you need to multiply your damage.

You can borrow some things like health-bars, queue animations, tap-to-win system etc.

p.s.: do not perceive it as a final game, its just funny proto
